            As a BTech CS student, my experience primarily comes from my coursework, projects, and some personal initatives I've taken to enhance my skills.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my coursework,I've gained hands-on experience with programming languages like C , C++ and Python.I,ve completed several projects that have helped me apply theoretical concepts to practical problems.For example, Water irrigation System using AI . 
            I've also worked on developing my skills outside of the classrooms. I've been using Blender 3D to create 3D models .
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition, I've done some video editing projects . These exoeriences have sharpened my attention to detail and taught me how to effectively communicate ideas visually.
